# Build Your Own Custom Chatbot

As a part of Generative Artifcial Intelligence Nanodegree program by Udacity, this is my second project on "Build Your Own Custom Chatbot". 
In this project I have build my own custom chatbot using openai. This chatbot will answer the questions based on my dataset which is wikipedia page of 2022.  

1. Dataset Selection:- I've used wikipedia wikipedia 2022 page to create dataset. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022

2. Prepare the Dataset for the Custom Query Process
I have formatted the dataset so that it can be loaded as a pandas dataframe with a column called "text".

3. Perform the Custom Query Process
I have integrated the dataset with the custom query code.

4. Write Questions to Demonstrate Custom Performance
In the last cells of the notebook, there are spaces for "Question 1" and "Question 2". 
I have asked following questions:-
"What has happened in sports in 2022?"
"What was the impact of COVID-19 in 2022?"
"Who are the five permanent members of the UN Security Council?"
"Abdalla Hamdok has resigned from which position in 2022?"
"where was the first successful heart transplant from a pig to a human patient occured?"
